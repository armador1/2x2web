        In this webpage you can search information about <b>any</b> 2x2 state. In order to reduce the number of states, we take "equivalent"
        states as only one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two states are said to be equivalents if they both can be solved with the same moves from some orientation. Most 
        states have 23 equivalent corresponding to the 23 possible orientation, but there are also states with less. This notion of equivalence
        allowed us to reduce the number of states from 3674160 to 154608 unique states. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These states were then classified into the main advanced methods for 2x2 speedsolving. For the states that are not a case of any 
        method, we <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The database queries are based on two inputs: which methods you want to include in your results and what methods you want to tables_exclude
